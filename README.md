# ExtractGEO
### This is an interactive python-based datasets retriever for the GEO database

This data retriever offers a very straightforward and user-friendly way to access GEO data.\
The `ExtractGEO` package takes inputs from the end-user and makes it easy for the user to query and download data from the [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database.\
The GEO database contains publicly available high-throughput functional genomics data, such as **microarray**, **next-generation sequencing**

## About

## Technologies

#### Built With
This project is created with:
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)

- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
- [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
#### Installation

**METHOD 1**

You can install the module by running `python setup.py install`

If you have **Python** installed, use `pip` from the terminal or a package manager such as `conda`:

1. Option 1: install using **pip** \
`pip install ExtractGEO`

2. Option 2: install using **conda**: \
`conda install ExtractGEO -c conda-forge`

##### NOTE:
- If you don’t have Python installed we recommend installing it using the `Anaconda installer` then running the conda install command above.
  - _When installing Anaconda through the installer, make sure that the ‘add to PATH’ option is checked._


**METHOD 2** From Source

If you want to use the current development version of the software either use `pip` to install directly from **GitHub**:

1. Option 1: \
`pip install [github-link]`

2. Option 2: Clone the repository \
`cd` into the repository directory and run `pip install`.
(you may need to include sudo at the beginning of the command depending on your system).

3. Option 3: Using **Git** \
